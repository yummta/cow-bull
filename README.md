# Cows and Bulls online game

This is the numerical version of the game Cows and Bulls, is usually played with 4 digits. The players each choose a 4-digit secret number. Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", if in different positions, they are "cows".

Example:

- Secret number: 4271
- Opponent's try: 1234
- Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)

The first one to reveal the other's secret number in the least number of guesses wins the game.
